# SC1015 mini Project on World Happiness Report


## About

This is the code for the Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). We based our project on the dataset [World Happiness Report up to 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/world-happiness-report), from Kaggle.

## Problem Definition
How can we determine the most important factors affecting a countryâ€™s Happiness?

## Models Used
1. Linear Regression
2. Support Vector Regression

## Conclusion
 - Numerical variables such as GDP per capita, social support and health life expectancy had the highest correlation with happiness score
 - Region, despite being a categorical variable, when combined with other variable can be a good predictor of happiness score
 

## What did we learn from this project
- Support Vector Regression
- Concepts on kernels
- Data cleaning with different headers/datasets of different sizes
